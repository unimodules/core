# @unimodules/core

This library contains the core Unimodule infrastructure and a collection of Unimodules and interfaces that are commonly depended on by other Unimodules.
You will need to install this before using libraries from Foundation, like `expo-camera`, `expo-media-library`, and others.

## Installation

The easiest way to do this is to initialize a "custom" project with `expo-cli`. If you have an existing app, you can follow these steps instead.
**This project requires that you use Cocoapods on iOS**, to set iot up see [this gist](https://gist.github.com/brentvatne/b0ea11a36dc423e441b7d36e36eb5a26), or relevant parts of the [this guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/integration-with-existing-apps#3-install-cocoapods).

### Install the package

```bash
npm install @unimodules/core
```

### Configure iOS

- Go back to the `ios` directory and open your Podfile, make your Podfile look [like this one](https://gist.github.com/brentvatne/6a1dcb32f6ca3d478eed4c7dc8fbdd24).
  - If you need to customize the path to node_modules, for example because you are using yarn workspaces, then you can pass in a param for this: `use_unimodules!(node_modules_path: '../../../node_modules')`
- Run `pod install` again
- Update your `AppDelegate.h` and `AppDelegate.m` according to [this diff](https://gist.github.com/brentvatne/949d9cc3508cc45f54af5196b3ca497b/revisions).

#### Add permission usage description keys to `Info.plist`

In order to submit your app to the App Store, you will need to eventually add these keys to your `Info.plist`. Even if you don't use the APIs described, you need to include the keys because code related to asking the permission will be bundled regardless, and Apple's static analysis tools will detect it and reject your app if the key isn't present. Including the key without using it has no impact to your users - iOS app permissions are requested at runtime and not listed in the app store listing as they are on Android. Test the permission prompts and customize the message as needed.

```xml
<key>NSCalendarsUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your calendar</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to use the camera</string>
<key>NSContactsUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) experiences to access your contacts</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to use your location</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to use your location</string>
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to use your location</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your microphone</string>
<key>NSMotionUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your device's accelerometer</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>Give $(PRODUCT_NAME) periences permission to save photos</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>Give $(PRODUCT_NAME) periences permission to access your photos</string>
<key>NSRemindersUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your reminders</string>
```

### Configure Android

- Add `apply from: '../node_modules/@unimodules/core/settings.gradle'` and then `useUnimodules.apply()` to the top of  `android/settings.gradle`
  - If you need to customize the path to node_modules, for example because you are using yarn workspaces, then you can pass in a param for this: `useUnimodules.apply(nodeModulesPath: "../../../node_modules")`
- Add `apply from: '../../node_modules/@unimodules/core/build.gradle'` anywhere in `android/app/build.gradle`
- Update `minSdkVersion` in `android/build.gradle` to 21
- Update your `MainApplication.java` to according to [this diff](https://gist.github.com/brentvatne/eb4606e39d5d5e6a764c16acde82198a/revisions#diff-a2e7ff8a82f1c4be06f8b8163f2afefa).

#### Add permissions to AndroidManifest.xml

Add whichever of the following permissions you would like to use in your app to `android/app/src/main`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_CONTACTS" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_CALENDAR" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_CALENDAR" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_SETTINGS" />
```

## API

It's possible that you will not have to use any of the code provided by this package directly, it may be used only by other Unimodules that you install.

But it's likely that you will want to use something like FileSystem or Permissions, and to do that you can import the following modules like so:

```js
import {
  Asset,
  Constants,
  FileSystem,
  Permissions,
} from '@unimodules/core';
```

You can import them directly from the specific Unimodule packag if you like, but your linter may complain for import a transitive dependency.

```js
import * as Permissions from 'expo-permissions';
```
